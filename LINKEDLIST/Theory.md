Linked List – Theory

A Linked List is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers. 
Each node contains:
Data – stores the actual value.
Pointer/Next – stores the reference/address of the next node in the sequence.

Some types of linked lists include:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both next and previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: Last node points back to the first node.

Advantages of Linked List

Dynamic Size: Can grow or shrink during runtime.

Efficient Insertions/Deletions: No shifting of elements required.

Better Memory Utilization: Allocates memory as needed.

Flexible Memory: Nodes can be stored anywhere in memory.
Foundation for Other Data Structures: Used in stacks, queues, graphs, etc.

Disadvantages of Linked List

No Random Access: Accessing an element requires traversal (O(n)).
Extra Memory: Each node requires additional memory for a pointer.
Pointer Overhead: Managing pointers increases complexity.
